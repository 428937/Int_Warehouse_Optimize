# Int_Warehouse_Optimize
An integer optimization problem solved with python using PuLP, it is about a warehouse selection and cost minimization.

**Problem Definition**

A company operates multiple warehouses and must distribute products to several cities. Each warehouse has a fixed opening cost and a limited shipping capacity, while each city has a fixed demand that must be fully satisfied.

The objective is to determine:
1-) Which warehouses should be opened
2-) How much product should be shipped from each warehouse to each city

The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes warehouse opening costs and transportation costs, while respecting capacity and demand constraints. This problem is formulated as an integer linear optimization model using binary and continuous decision variables.
